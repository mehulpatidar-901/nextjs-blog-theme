Interruption is almost inevitable when journalists film news segments outdoors. The uncontrollable factors may include construction noise, traffic noise, weather conditions, and even animals. While in most cases, journalists try to keep their composure when facing these annoying things, their attempts aren't always successful. Let’s meet journalist Alvin Kaunda, who failed to stay calm in front of the uninvited guests in his news!

On the day, Kaunda was at the Sheldrick Wildlife Trust, a rescue and rehabilitation center for animals in Kenya. He was filming for KBC News when suddenly, one of the habitants at the shelter intervened.

The journalist was standing near several young elephants of the Trust while conveying a message about the grave threat the elephants and other wild animals were facing. The animals did no harm and only paid attention to their business in the background, but that was before one of them began to jostle around Kaunda’s face with his trunk.
